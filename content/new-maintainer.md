Slug: irina
Status: draft


About 2 years ago I (Amjith) made a modest announcement about launching `pgcli` a CLI
client for Postgres with auto-completion. Since then `pgcli` has grown at a
tremendous pace. We have over 4900 stars on github, released 39 versions,
merged 320 pull requests from over 60 different contributors. We established a
core team which has 7 team members and we're always looking for interested
folks to join the team. Our only requirement is "be nice and welcoming to
everyone".

I'm happy to announce that [Irina](https://github.com/j-bennet) has volunteered
to take over the role of maintaining the pgcli project. I will be staying as
part of the core team but Irina will be in charge of the direction of the
project. 

A little bit about Irina, she is the earliest contributor of pgcli. In fact she
started contributing  even before it was announced publicly. She's a personal
friend and a great programmer. She's also the creator of the tremendously
useful docker tool [wharfee](http://wharfee.com/).

Why am I stepping down? There are two reasons, one I have a six month old baby
at home and I'm sleep deprived and tired all the time. Second, I've done
everything I can to make pgcli a success but I think I've depleted my ideas and
I've become stagnant. It is time to bring a fresh perspective to the project.

I want to thank Irina for stepping up and the rest of the core team for their
support.
