The pgspecial package is now independent and has its own place on PyPI:
 
# [pgspecial](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pgspecial)

The package provides an API for developers who wish to run meta-commands on
PostgreSQL database without invoking the command line or rolling out their own
custom solution. It is easily extendable.

To learn more about the package or to contribute, follow the
[github](https://github.com/dbcli/pgspecial) link.
