About a month ago, I started a new [kickstarter
project](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1839007321/mysql-cli) to create a
MySQL client that can do auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

An equivalent of [pgcli](http://pgcli.com) for the MySQL database.

Today I'm happy to announce that the kickstarter has reached it's [goal](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1839007321/mysql-cli) and it's
strongly marching towards the stretch goal. 

Thank you everyone for pitching in and helping me reach the goal.

This is the last day to back the project, if you'd like to get early access to the app.

I would like to extend my thanks to the first Gold sponsor
[jweiland.net](https://jweiland.net/). The boost from their generous
contribution gave me the confidence that we'll reach the goal.

Thanks to all the supporters who spread the word and pitched in. I appreciate it very much.
