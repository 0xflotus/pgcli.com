Pgcli was launched_ approximately one week ago.

It was an extremely successful launch, beyond any of my wildest imaginations. 

Obligatory Vanity Metrics: 
==========================

* Google Analytics: 21K views and 12.2K users.
* Twitter_: 70 retweets, 68 favs.
* Github_: 1,230 stars, 45 forks, 28 watchers.
* HackerNews_: 227 points

Enough with the vanity.

Highlights
==========

Here are some metrics that I'm personally proud to present. Since launch.

* Pull Requests Opened: 40
* Pull Requests Merged: 38
* Issues Opened: 62
* Issues Closed: 34

Let's break it down a little bit more. 

* **Number of Releases: 5**
* Number of Features Added: 11
* Features added by community: 11
* Bugs fixed by community: 10
* Features added by author: 1
* Bugs fixed by author: 3

I have not included the numerous typo fixes contributed by the community. (yes,
I'm a little bit ashamed by how many mistakes I make when I type).

I'm flattered by how many people pitched in to help fix bugs and add features.
At one point I found a bug and filed an issue to keep track of it and 5 minutes
later I got a pull request to fix it. I was completely floored by the
enthusiasm shown by the contributors.

I had an internal goal of responding to Pull Requests, Issues and emails within
24 hours. Even if I couldn't fix the issue or implement a requested feature, I
wanted to acknowledge it and give feedback about whether I'll do it or not. I
was able to keep that goal, as you'll see every issue_ in Github right now has
a comment from me (except for the ones I filed myself).

I was also able to keep up the responsibility_ I outlined the about page.

Phew! What a week. I feel invigorated and refueled. Looking forward to working
through the issues and feature requests.
