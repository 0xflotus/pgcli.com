Today we're proud to announce a new project called `vcli`. This is a Command

## Who?

The main author of `vcli` is [Chang-Hung
Liang](https://github.com/eliangcs). He took the source code for pgcli and
repurposed it to work with VerticaDB. The `vcli` project will be hosted under
the `dbcli` org in github. This enables us to share the code among the various
project easily and learn from each other.
