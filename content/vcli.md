Today we're proud to announce a new project called `vcli`. This is a Command
Line tool for VerticaDB that is based on pgcli.

Source: [https://github.com/dbcli/vcli](https://github.com/dbcli/vcli)

## Who?

The main author of `vcli` is [Chang-Hung
Liang](https://github.com/eliangcs). He took the source code for pgcli and
repurposed it to work with VerticaDB. The `vcli` project will be hosted under
the `dbcli` org in github. This enables us to share the code among the various
project easily and learn from each other.

Please feel free to report any bugs or feature requests on
[Github](https://github.com/dbcli/vcli/issues).
