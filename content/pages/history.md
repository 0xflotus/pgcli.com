Title: History and Search
Slug: history
status: hidden

Pgcli keeps track of the queries entered in the repl. Up/Down arrow can be used to navigate the history. 

Pgcli will automatically suggest commands from the history that match the starting characters of the command you've typed so far. In order to accept that suggestion, you can press the `right-arrow` key. 

Pressing `<C-r>` will enable incremental history search. So press `<C-r>` and then
start typing your search term to see the queries narrowed down. You can cycle
through the matches by pressing `<C-r>` again.
