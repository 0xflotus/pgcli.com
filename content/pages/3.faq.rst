These are some questions that the author wishes everyone would ask, since he
knows the answers for them. 

1. **Why does pgcli exist?**

   I'm a huge fan of CLIs. Especially REPLs. When I first encountered
   BPython_, I fell in love with it. BPython is a Python REPL that has
   auto-completion, syntax-highlighting and displays the docstring of functions
   as you type. Once you get used to that level of pampering, all other REPLs
   start to look like `Dumb Terminals`_. 

   When I started using psql_ for interacting with my Postgres database, I
   yearned for a BPython equivalent for psql. 

   One fine day I got a twitter DM from `Jonathan Slenders`_ asking me if I'd
   be interested in trying a new Python library that he's working on called
   `Python-Prompt-Toolkit`_. This library provided a way to write CLIs without
   having to deal with curses and had the requisite tools for doing
   auto-completion and syntax-highlighting. So I jumped at the opportunity to
   try it out. After I got myself familiarized, I started writing pgcli to
   scratch my own itch. 
   
   So this app exists because Jonathan was kind enough to request my feedback.

2. **Will there be an equivalent of this for Sqlite?**
   
   Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
   commands), I'd like to write an Sqlite CLI. But I'm not sure if I'll have
   the time to do it in the near future. But if you're interested in doing it,
   I'd be happy to help you.

3. **Will there be an equivalent of this for MySql?**

   Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
   commands), I'd like to write an MySql CLI. But I'm not sure if I'll have
   the time to do it in the near future. But if you're interested in doing it,
   I'd be happy to help you.

4. **Why is this not version 1.0?**

   The backbone of pgcli is `Python-Prompt-Toolkit`_. Prompt Toolkit is awesome at
   what it does, but the APIs for the library are still evolving. So I'm
   hesitant to mark pgcli as 1.0, since pgcli will also be changing to keep up
   with the changes in Prompt Tookit. I'll probably release v1.0 when
   Python-Prompt-Toolkit goes 1.0.

   project. 

7. **I found a bug, what do I do?** 

   Whoopsie Daisies! I'm sorry you encountered a bug. Please file a bug on
   Github Issues_ for this project.

8. **I have a feature request, what do I do?** 

   Sweet! Open a new item on Github Issues_. Alternatively, you can take a stab
   at implementing the new feature yourself. If you'd like some guidance, I'm

    frequently asked question. So here it goes:
