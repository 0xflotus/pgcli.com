Install

:slug: install

Quick start:
------------

If you already know how to install python packages, then you can simply do:
You might need ``sudo``.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install pgcli

    or 

    $ easy_install install pgcli

Detailed:
---------

For installing Python packages it is recommended to use the package manager
called ``pip``. There is also an older package manager known as
``easy_install`` but it is superseded by pip.

Check if ``pip`` is installed on the system.

.. code:: bash

    $ which pip

If the above command returns an error, then you do not have pip installed on
your computer. You can install pip for your OS using one of the following
methods.

Linux:
~~~~~~

Debian based systems (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint etc)

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

For Redhat based systems (Fedora, Centos, RHEL etc)

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo yum install python-pip

After this you can simply do:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo pip install pgcli

Mac OS X:
~~~~~~~~~

Most OS X systems comes pre-installed with python and ``easy_install``. You can
use easy_install to install ``pip``.

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo easy_install install pip
    
    $ sudo pip install pgcli
