    <h1 class="entry-title">FAQ</h1>
    
    <p>These are some questions that the author wishes everyone would ask, since he
knows the answers for them.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Why does pgcli exist?</strong></p>
<p>I'm a huge fan of CLIs. Especially REPLs. When I first encountered
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bpython-interpreter.org/">BPython</a>, I fell in love with it. BPython is a Python REPL that has
auto-completion, syntax-highlighting and displays the docstring of functions
as you type. Once you get used to that level of pampering, all other REPLs
start to look like <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_terminal#Dumb_terminals">Dumb Terminals</a>.</p>
<p>When I started using <a class="reference external" href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/app-psql.html">psql</a> for interacting with my Postgres database, I
yearned for a BPython equivalent for psql.</p>
<p>One fine day I got a twitter DM from <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders">Jonathan Slenders</a> asking me if I'd
be interested in trying a new Python library that he's working on called
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit">Python-Prompt-Toolkit</a>. This library provided a way to write CLIs without
having to deal with curses and had the requisite tools for doing
auto-completion and syntax-highlighting. So I jumped at the opportunity to
try it out. After I got myself familiarized, I started writing pgcli to
scratch my own itch.</p>
<p>So this app exists because Jonathan was kind enough to request my feedback.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Will there be an equivalent of this for Sqlite?</strong></p>
<p>Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
commands), I'd like to write an Sqlite CLI. But I'm not sure if I'll have
the time to do it in the near future. But if you're interested in doing it,
I'd be happy to help you.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Will there be an equivalent of this for MySql?</strong></p>
<p>Probably. Now that I've worked out the hard parts (sqlcompletion and special
commands), I'd like to write an MySql CLI. But I'm not sure if I'll have
the time to do it in the near future. But if you're interested in doing it,
I'd be happy to help you.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>Why is this not version 1.0?</strong></p>
<p>The backbone of pgcli is <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit">Python-Prompt-Toolkit</a>. Prompt Toolkit is awesome at
what it does, but the APIs for the library are still evolving. So I'm
hesitant to mark pgcli as 1.0, since pgcli will also be changing to keep up
with the changes in Prompt Tookit. I'll probably release v1.0 when
Python-Prompt-Toolkit goes 1.0.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic" start="5">
<li><p class="first"><strong>What is the license for pgcli?</strong></p>
<p>BSD 3-clause license. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/blob/master/LICENSE.txt">https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/blob/master/LICENSE.txt</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>How can I get support for pgcli?</strong></p>
<p>The best resource at the moment is to use the Github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/issues">Issues</a> page for this
project.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I found a bug, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Whoopsie Daisies! I'm sorry you encountered a bug. Please file a bug on
Github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/issues">Issues</a> for this project.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I have a feature request, what do I do?</strong></p>
<p>Sweet! Open a new item on Github <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/amjith/pgcli/issues">Issues</a>. Alternatively, you can take a stab
at implementing the new feature yourself. If you'd like some guidance, I'm
just an email away. Don't hesitate to <a class="reference external" href="./about">contact</a> me.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>I want to contribute to this project, how do I do that?</strong></p>
<p>Awesome! I thought you'd never ask. Here's a <a class="reference external" href="./develop">developer guide</a> that provides basic info on getting
started with local development. You're also welcome to <a class="reference external" href="./about">contact</a> me, if you need some help getting
started.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first"><strong>What's your favorite cuisine?</strong></p>
<p>What's the point in having an FAQ if I don't include at least one
frequently asked question. So here it goes:</p>
<p>South Indian, North Indian, Thai, Mexican, Mediterranean, Ethiopian,
Japanese, Chinese, Sandwiches, Salads. In that order.</p>
